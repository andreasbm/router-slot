## ‚û§ Installation

```node
npm i @appnest/web-router
```


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#the-basics)

## ‚û§ The Basics

This section will introduce the basics of the router.

### `<base href>`

Your application should add a `<base>` element to the `index.html` in the `<head>` tag. If your file is located in the root, the `href` value should be the following:

```html
<base href="/">
```

### Router import

To import the library you'll need to import the dependency in your application.

```javascript
import "@appnest/web-router";
```

### `router-slot`

The `router-slot` component acts as a placeholder that marks the spot in the template where the router should display the components for that route part.

```html
<router-slot>
	<!-- Routed components will go here -->
</router-slot>
```

### Configuration

Routes are added to the router through the `add` function on a `router-slot` component. Specify the parts of the path you want it to math with or use the `**` wildcard to catch all paths. The router has no routes until you configure it. The example below creates three routes. The first route path matches urls starting with `login` and will lazy load the login component. Remember to export the login component as default in the `./pages/login` file like this `export default LoginComponent { ... }`. The second route matches all urls starting with `home` and will stamp the `HomeComponent` in the `web-router`. The third route matches all paths that the two routes before didn't catch and redirects to home. This can also be useful for displaying "404 - Not Found" pages.

```javascript
const routerSlot = document.querySelector("router-slot");
await routerSlot.add([
  {
    path: "login",
    component: () => import("./pages/login") // Lazy loaded
  },
  {
    path: "home",
    component: HomeComponent // Not lazy loaded
  },
  {
    path: "**",
    redirectTo: "home"
  }
]);
```

You may want to wrap the above in a `whenDefined` callback to ensure the `router-slot` exists before using its logic.

```javascript
customElements.whenDefined("router-slot").then(async () => {
  ...
});
```

### Navigation

In order to change a route you can either use the [`history`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) API directly or the `router-link` component.

#### History API

Here's an example on how to navigate.

```javascript
history.pushState(null, "", "/login");
```

Or (if you want to replace the state and not keep the current one in the history)

```javascript
history.replaceState(null, "", "/login");
```

You can also go back and forth between the states!

```javascript
history.back();
history.forward();
```

#### `router-link`

With the `router-link` component you add `<router-link>` to your markup and specify a path. Whenever the component is clicked it will navigate to the specified path. Whenever the path of the router link is active the active attribute is set.

```html
<router-link path="/home/secret">
  <button>Go to the secret page!</button>
</router-link>
```

Paths can be specified either in relative or absolute terms. To specify an absolute path you simply pass `/home/secret`. The slash makes the URL absolute. To specify a relative path you first have to be aware of the `router-slot` context you are navigating within. The `router-link` component will navigate based on the nearest parent `router-slot` element. If you give the component a path (without the slash), the navigation will be done in relation to the parent `router-slot`. You can also specify `../login` to traverse up the router tree.

## ‚û§ `lit-element`

The `web-router` works very well with `lit-element`. Check out the example below to get an idea on how you could use this router in your own `lit-element` based projects.

```typescript
import { LitElement, html } from "lit-element";
import "@appnest/web-router/router-slot";

const ROUTES = [
 {
   path: "login",
   component: () => import("./pages/login")
 },
 {
   path: "home",
   component: () => import("./pages/home")
 },
 {
   path: "**",
   redirectTo: "home"
 }
];

export class AppComponent extends LitElement {
  render () {
    return html`<router-slot .routes="${ROUTES}"></router-slot>`;
  }
}

customElements.define("app-component", AppComponent);
```

## ‚û§ Advanced

You can customize a lot in this library. Continue reading to learn how to handle your new superpowers.

### Guards

A guard is a function that determines whether the route can be activated or not. The example below checks whether the user has a session saved in the local storage and redirects the user to the login page if the access is not provided. If a guard returns false the routing is cancelled.

```typescript
funtion sessionGuard () {

  if (localStorage.getItem("session") == null) {
    history.replaceState(null, "", "/login");
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```

Add this guard to the add function in the `guards` array.

```typescript
...
await routerSlot.add([
  ...
  {
    path: "home",
    component: HomeComponent,
    guards: [sessionGuard]
  },
  ...
]);
```

### Dialog routes

Sometimes you wish to change the url without triggering the route change. This could for example be when you want an url for your dialog. To change the route without triggering the route change you can use the functions prefixed with `_` on the history object. Below is an example on how to show a dialog without triggering the route change.

```javascript
history.native.pushState(null, "", "dialog");
alert("This is a dialog");
history.native.back();
```

This allows dialogs to have a route which is especially awesome on mobile.

### Params

If you want params in your URL you can do it by using the `:name` syntax. Below is an example on how to specify a path that matches params as well. This route would match urls such as `user/123`, `user/@andreas`, `user/abc` and so on.

```typescript
...
await routerSlot.add([
  {
    path: "user/:userId",
    component: UserComponent
  }
]);
```

To grab the params in the `UserComponent` you can use the `routeMatch` from the parent router as shown in the example below.

```typescript
import { LitElement, html } from "lit-element";
import { Params, queryParentRouterSlot } from "@appnest/web-router";

export default class UserComponent extends LitElement {

  get params (): Params {
    return queryParentRouterSlot(this)!.match!.params;
  }

  render () {
    const {userId} = this.params;
    return html`
      <p>:userId = <b>${userId}</b></p>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define("user-component", UserComponent);
```

Alternatively the params can be passed through the setup function.

```javascript
await routerSlot.add([
  {
    path: "user/:userId",
    component: UserComponent,
    setup: (component: UserComponent, info: RoutingInfo) => {
      component.userId = info.match.params.userId;
    }
  }
]);
```

### Deep dive into the different route kinds

There exists three different kinds of routes. We are going to take a look at those different kinds in a bit, but first you should be familiar with what all routes have in common.

```typescript
export interface IRouteBase<T = any> {

  // The path for the route fragment
  path: PathFragment;

  // Optional metadata
  data?: T;

  // If guard returns false, the navigation is not allowed
  guards?: Guard[];

  // Whether the match is fuzzy (eg. "name" would not only match "name" or "name/" but also "path/to/name")
  fuzzy?: boolean;
}
```

#### Component routes

Component routes resolves a specified component. You can provide the `component` property with either a class that instantiates a `web component` or a function that imports the component lazily.

```typescript
export interface IComponentRoute extends IRouteBase {

  // The component loader (should return a module with a default export)
  component: Class | ModuleResolver | PageComponent | (() => Class) | (() => PageComponent) | (() => ModuleResolver);

  // A custom setup function for the instance of the component.
  setup?: SetupComponent;
}
```

#### Redirection routes

A redirection route is good to use to catch all of the paths that the routes before did not catch. This could for example be used to handle "404 - Page not found" cases.

```typescript
export interface IRedirectRoute extends IRouteBase {

  // The paths the route should redirect to. Can either be relative or absolute.
  redirectTo: string;

  // Whether the query should be preserved when redirecting.
  preserveQuery?: boolean;
}
```

#### Resolver routes

Use the resolver routes when you want to customize what should happen when the path matches the route. This is good to use if you for example want to show a dialog instead of navigating to a new component.

```typescript
export interface IResolverRoute extends IRouteBase {

  // A custom resolver that handles the route change
  resolve: CustomResolver;
}
```

### Stop the user from navigating away

Let's say you have a page where the user has to enter some important data and suddenly he/she clicks on the back button! Luckily you can cancel the the navigation before it happens by listening for the `willchangestate` event on the `window` object and calling `preventDefault()` on the event.

```javascript
const confirmNavigation = e => {

  // Check if we should navigate away from this page
  if (!confirm("You have unsafed data. Do you wish to discard it?")) {
    e.preventDefault();
    return;
  }

  window.removeEventListener("willchangestate", confirmNavigation);
};
window.addEventListener("willchangestate", confirmNavigation);
```

### Helper functions

The library comes with a set of helper functions. This includes:

* `path()` - The current path of the location.
* `query()` - The current query as an object.
* `queryString()` - The current query string
* `toQuery(queryString)` - Splits a query string and returns the query.
* `toQueryString(query)` - Turns a query object into a string query.
* `stripSlash(options)` - Strips the slash from the start and end of a path.
* `ensureSlash(options)` - Ensures the path starts and ends with a slash.

### Global navigation events

You are able to listen to the navigation related events that are dispatched every time something important happens. They are dispatched on the `window` object.

```typescript
// An event triggered when a new state is added to the history.
window.addEventListener("pushstate", (e: PushStateEvent) => {
  console.log("On push state", path());
});

// An event triggered when the current state is replaced in the history.
window.addEventListener("replacestate", (e: ReplaceStateEvent) => {
  console.log("On replace state", path());
});

// An event triggered when a state in the history is popped from the history.
window.addEventListener("popstate", (e: PopStateEvent) => {
  console.log("On pop state", path());
});

// An event triggered when the state changes (eg. pop, push and replace)
window.addEventListener("changestate", (e: ChangeStateEvent) => {
  console.log("On change state", path());
});

// A cancellable event triggered before the history state changes.
window.addEventListener("willchangestate", (e: WillChangeStateEvent) => {
  console.log("Before the state changes. Call 'e.preventDefault()' to prevent the state from changing.");
});

// An event triggered when navigation starts.
window.addEventListener("navigationstart", (e: NavigationStartEvent) => {
  console.log("Navigation start", e.detail);
});

// An event triggered when navigation is canceled. This is due to a Route Guard returning false during navigation.
window.addEventListener("navigationcancel", (e: NavigationCancelEvent) => {
  console.log("Navigation cancelled", e.detail);
});

// An event triggered when navigation ends.
window.addEventListener("navigationend", (e: NavigationEndEvent) => {
  console.log("Navigation end", e.detail);
});

// An event triggered when navigation fails due to an unexpected error.
window.addEventListener("navigationerror", (e: NavigationErrorEvent) => {
  console.log("Navigation failed", e.detail);
});

// An event triggered when navigation successfully completes.
window.addEventListener("navigationsuccess", (e: NavigationSuccessEvent) => {
  console.log("Navigation failed", e.detail);
});
```

#### Scroll to the top

If you want to scroll to the top on each page change to could consider doing the following.

```typescript
window.addEventListener(GlobalRouterEventKind.NavigationEnd, () => {
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    window.scrollTo(0, 0);
  });
});
```

## ‚û§ Be careful when navigating to the root!

From my testing I found that Chrome and Safari treat an empty string as url when navigating differently. As an example `history.pushState(null, null, "")` will navigate to the root of the website in Chrome but in Safari the path won't change. The workaround I found was to simply pass "/" when navigating to the root of the website instead.
